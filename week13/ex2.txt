Recovery might be better when deadlocks are unlikely and we want to save CPU time. It deals with deadlocks only when they occur.

Prevention might be better if we want to have a guarantee that a deadlock will not occur. Prevention will take more resources than any other approach.

Avoidance might be better if we know in advance when resource granting to a process is safe. This approach will help to avoid deadlocks and will not consume much CPU time.
