    Compared to previous jobs, time increases because RR splits all processes into quantums. In this case, counting takes
 longer because the process is performed several times but partially.

  In the first case, the sorting occurs at the time of arrival, when in the second case, sorting by minimum burst time but
  taking into account arrival time. Third, we break down the processes into quantum time.
