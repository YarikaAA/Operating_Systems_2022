	'Pstree' shows the running processes as a tree,  and visually shows the hierarchy.
	
	Numbers of processes in each case are different. In case of enougt time for execute we
	will have 2^n processes. 
	
	For 1st case:
		n = 3 => We must have 8 processes, but some time processes processes do not have time to create or complete. (We can check them with their IDs)
		
	For 2nd case:
		n = 5 => We must have 32 processes, but some time processes processes do not have time to create or complete. (We can check them with their IDs)
