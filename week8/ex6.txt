Task:

	A machine has 16-bit virtual addresses. Pages are 8 KB. How
	many entries are needed for a single-level linear page table?

Solution:

	Pages have a size of 8 KB, or 2^13 bytes. Offset size is hence 13 bits.
	Pages are needing certain bits, (16 - 13) bits equal 3 bits.
	As a result, the single-level linear page table has 2^3 = 8 pages.
