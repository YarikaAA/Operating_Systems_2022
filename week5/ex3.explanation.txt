	
	In this program we consider the number of primes in the range up to n.

	In this subtask, all the numbers are distributed in pieces. That is, for example, the first process extends numbers from 1 to 10 when the last receives numbers from 1,000,000 to 2,000,000. 

	As a result, this increases runtime (because the runtime with large numbers is much higher).
