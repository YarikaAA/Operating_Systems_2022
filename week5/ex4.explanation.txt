	
	In this program we consider the number of primes in the range up to n.

	In this subtask, all numbers are distributed evenly by processes. That is, for example, the first process bypasses the numbers: 1, 4; the next receives the numbers: 2, 5; third 3, 6; and so on.

	As a result, the time of each process is uniform. 

	The execution time of 4 exercise is less than 3. 
	But the difference is not significant, we can say that the execution time in 4 tasks is more evenly distributed.
